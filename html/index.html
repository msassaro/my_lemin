		<h1 class="red">SYNOPSIS</h1>
		<p>
		The goal of the LEM-IN project is to find the
		shortest paths between rooms.<br/>
		You have a starting point and an ending point.<br/>
		<br/>
		All ants are starting at the start point and they
		have to go to the end point. (captain obvious).<br/>
		<br/>
		For each room (or node), there is only a capacity
		of 1 ant. So only one ant per room.
		</p>

		<h1 class="red">TECHNICALS</h1>
		<p>
		The lem-in read directly from STDIN or a file sent
		as a STDIN.<br/>
		<br/>
		If there is an issue with a line, the recuperation
		process stops and the lem-in will try to solve<br/>
		with the informations it has got before the break
		point.<br/>
		<br/>
		If there is some issue, the lem-in will quit
		with ERROR.
